Scripts that are made for Windows to run Tarsnap using Cygwin. Mixture of my own work + edits of others

# 2016/02/21
*cygsnap.ps1 is a script that I took from @breiter - https://gist.github.com/breiter/536af352d561d34cdfab <br />
I modified it a bit, and added some adjustments - IIRC - mostly packages that I saw are required later for the style of my setup. <br />
The setup guide for Tarsnap installation on Windows using cygwin is here - http://www.eidmantas.lt/setting-up-tarsnap-with-windows/  <br />
Hopefully it helps someone out there. Thanks to @breiter again for publishing his script.  <br />

*Will add Windows Tarsnap backup scripts later to this repo <br />
*Will add Linux Tarsnap backup scripts later to an another repo  <br />
